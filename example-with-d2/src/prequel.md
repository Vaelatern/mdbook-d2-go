# Prequel

This book is an example of shoving lots of documents in a single place.

This doesn't get parsed into a document

```
x -> y -> z
```

But this same one does:

```d2
x -> y -> z
```

How about that!

And this one links to chapter 1

```d2
Click Me {link: /chapter_1.md}
```

Or how about a backup strategy?

```d2
BackBlaze {shape: cloud} # definition BackBlaze
DVD {shape: circle} # definition DVD
Computer {shape: package} # definition Computer

Computer -> DVD
Computer -> BackBlaze : Weekly
DVD -> SpaceX LEO Storage Missions
```

Or a picture of a system failing?
